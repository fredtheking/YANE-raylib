# YANE â€” Yet Another Node Editor

**YANE** is a minimal **node sandbox** built with Raylib and C++20.

## âœ¨ Features

- Math nodes!
- Logic nodes!
- More nodes?
- TBD...

## ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s it for?

Mostly just for fun â€” maybe for prototyping.  
The future plan is to make it fully modular, so it can be embedded into other C++ projects.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- OpenGL dev packages  
- [Xmake](https://xmake.io/) build system  
- Internet connection (for dependencies)

## ðŸ”§ How to build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredtheking/YANE-raylib.git
cd YANE-raylib
xmake run -y
```

### Optional: Generate CMake project
```bash
xmake project -k cmake -y
```
